          <h2>A co-founder at one of the world's largest communities.</h2>
          <p>
            The combined experience I have working at the top Fortune 500
            companies has allowed me to develop a skillset that helps me in not
            just development, but in every aspect of any business.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one of the world's
            largest communities teaching young minds about how to
            <em>sell</em> yourself as a developer and opne them to a whole new
            world of opportunities.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a developer, you have everything available to you and all that's
            holding you back is yourself.
          </p>
          <p>A quote I live by perfectly illustrates what I mean.</p>
          <p>
            "How big would you dream, if you <strong>knew</strong> you wouldn't
            fail?" you've already gone through the hardest parts being a
            developer, it's time to elevate your skills and become a leader in
            something you're <em>passionate</em> about.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm happy to chat over coffee some time about how I can help your
            company.
